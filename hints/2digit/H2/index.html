      <p style = "font-size: xx-large; text-decoration: underline; padding-bottom: 10px;">The Polybius Square</p>
      <p>Have you ever heard of this? probably not (unless I've rambled about it at some point) but that's ok, I'm here to explain now</p>
      <p>Ok so the Polybius Square is thought to be made by an ancient greek philosopher called Polybius (shocker) and it works with a grid that is filled with the alphabet which is displayed below</p>
      <p>And we encode information by taking the co-ordinates of the letter box, starting with row and then column, so 23 is second row f g h i/j k and column, aka "H"
      <br>You may notice that "i" and "j" take up a single box this is because if ever it's referenced it can be either of the two though typically it will be "i"
      </p>
      <br>
      <div style = "font-family: monospace;" class = "polybius">
      <a class = "none"></a><a>1</a><a>2</a><a>3</a><a>4</a><a>5</a>
      <br><a>1</a><a>a</a><a>b</a><a>c</a><a>d</a><a>e</a>
      <br><a>2</a><a>f</a><a>g</a><a>h</a><a>i/j</a><a>k</a>
      <br><a>3</a><a>l</a><a>m</a><a>n</a><a>o</a><a>p</a>
      <br><a>4</a><a>q</a><a>r</a><a>s</a><a>t</a><a>u</a>
      <br><a>5</a><a>v</a><a>w</a><a>x</a><a>y</a><a>z</a>
      </div>
      <p>Ok so using the above chart/grid with the row first and column second we can encode any letter from the latin alphabet into a set of co-ordinates for this grid, this does however have it's downsides,
     <br>It removes capitalisation, spaces and numbers, this is because those specific characters are not in the table it's not possible to encode them.<br>There are other similar ciphers which include numbers but still not spaces .</p>
     <p style="padding-top: 10px;">Some people do however use 00 as a replacement for space</p>
